We must comply with the Data Protection Act 1988 \cite{Data Protection Act} as we process personal data in the form of our user's email address which could be used to identify them.  Therefore we should only process them when valid to do so under this act.  Also to deploy our application to many iOS devices that are not in our possession would require the purchase of the Apple Developer License \cite{Apple Developer Agreement} and to accommodate the rules set by it.
