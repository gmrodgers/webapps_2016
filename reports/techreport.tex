\section{Client-side}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Ruby on Rails}\\
We choose Rails as it allowed fast prototyping of our web application and followed the MVC architecture so it was easy to separate the view from the models and controllers.
\end{itemize}

\section{Server-side}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Swift}\\ 
\end{itemize}

\section{Version Control, Continuous Integration and Deployment}

\item \textbf{Github}\\
Used as our git repository hosting service as it provides free private repositories and we had used it before.
\item \textbf{CircleCI} (linked to github repo)\\
Used for continuous integration as it was easy to set up and works with Ruby on Rails.
\item \textbf{Code Climate} (linked to github repo)\\
Used by our group to monitor our overall code quality.  Allows us to see adjustments needed after every commit.
\item \textbf{Heroku} (linked to github repo)\\
We push to a remote Heroku repository which then deploys our backend onto its 
cloud platform.
