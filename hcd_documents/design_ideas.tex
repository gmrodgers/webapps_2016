I'm guessing this one is how we generated ideas about our app\\
Seems very similar to the first one\\
Talk about our research again and how we took inspiration from that\\
Also should talk about other app and how they inspired us\\

Eg
We examined other popular apps and seen features that users liked and tried to see if they could be applied to our own app. This included the swipe feature that apps like Tinder have which is a very natural action and when we applied it to our flashcards, users who tried it enjoyed our app much more.
