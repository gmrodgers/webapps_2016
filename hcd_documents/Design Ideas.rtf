A major issue we have encountered as students is the difficultly associated with studying. After we established that there was a problem, we set about finding the solutions. Before doing any coding we created a google form to help us gain insight into what different people find useful when studying and what major obstacles they encounter. This was extremely effective as we quickly knew what features to implement such as flash cards, colour coding and quizzes and what features to leave out such as audio integration. }
